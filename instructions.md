# Shoot the Zombie

* The entire game is kept in one directory for the sake of simplicity. it can be changed for your convenience later on
* i use webstorm local host server to open the `index.html` page since it wont open using the `file:\\\` protocol. there is nothing special about webstorm localhost server
* i run `json-server --watch post.json --port 4000` to start the json server to get and post the scores. 
* i play the game and open the applications section in the browser to see whats happening
