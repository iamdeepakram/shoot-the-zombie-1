## Problem Statement

A splash screen is the loader screen with the game logo flashed at the beginning of the game. You are given a binary file of an HTML5 game that is likely to be hosted on 10 different platforms with discrete brandings. Considering these facts in mind, solve for following:

- State your approach on how you can customize this game for 10 different platforms without manually changing the brand icon individually for each platform. 
- Make a call to an API and send the scores in JSON format at the end of each play.
- Record every time the game starts or ends as Session_ID for the given User_ID.
- This game consists of different levels, disable all the levels except level 1. 


```
*JSON Format
{
  "userid": 34,
  "score": "5000",
  "sessionid": “XH%^&O)LD”
}
```
